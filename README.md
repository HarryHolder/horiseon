# horiseon-code-refactor

## Description
This project was built as an on-the-job task. I was provided with a fully functional webpage that needed changes to the code in order to make it more accessible for users. This was achieved by replacing some of the element tags with semantic tags to help screen readers navigate the webpage. Alt attributes were also added to all the images in order to provide context for screen readers to those who may be visually impaired. 

As well as changes to the code for accessibility, changes were also made to tidy up the code. Unused class and id attributes were removed and this meant the css could be reduced and made easier to understand. Some H tags were also being used improperly and have been changed to follow the correct hierarchy order.
